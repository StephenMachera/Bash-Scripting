About This Project
This repository serves as a personal workbook for learning Bash. It contains a series of scripts, from simple "hello world" examples to more complex automation tasks. My motivation is to automate repetitive tasks, deepen my understanding of Linux system administration, and share my progress with the community.
Learning Goals
Syntax Fundamentals: Master the core syntax of Bash scripting, including variables, control flow, loops, and functions.
Automation: Write scripts to automate common tasks, such as file manipulation, backups, and system monitoring.
Command-Line Tools: Learn to combine and leverage powerful command-line tools like grep, awk, and sed.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and debugging techniques in scripts to make them reliable.
Best Practices: Adopt clean coding practices, including proper commenting, indentation, and variable naming conventions.
